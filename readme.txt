The Shiny application you are evaluating is simple to use.

Input the probability you believe a team or a player has winning a given game, then enter the number of games being played. The application uses the binomial distribution to figure out the expected number of wins over the total number of games. 100 repeats are used to come up with a reasonable distribution.
